## Overview and Origin

* __*Name of the Company*__

[SwissBorg S.A.](https://swissborg.com/)

* __*When was the company incorporated?*__

SwissBorg was founded in Switzerland in 2017. 

* __*Who are the founders of the company?*__

The original joint founders were Swiss nationals Cyrus Fazel and Anthony Lesoismier.

* __*How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?*__

The founders were working in wealth management when it dawned on them they were only focusing on 0.1% of the planet's population. Using blockchain, they felt they could potentially reach everyone and reduce the wealth gap at the same time. Given the nature, or volatility, that the crypto market presents, the founders wanted to create a platform for people to become better crypto investors and manage their crypto with a blockchain based wealth management ecosystem. Swissborg was the very first blockchain-based wealth management platform, specifically for cryptocurrency investments.

* __*How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?*__

The original ICO was late in 2017, around December, and ran into to early 2018. Once the ICO closed it was the 10th biggest ICO in the world attacting over 24,000 investors and totalling $52m USD. I was an initial CHSB ICO investor myself in 2017 and still own my original investment today.

They are raising additional funds and have Series A investment round ongoing at the moment. They are just under half way to their CHF 25m target.

The Series A investment will be distributed as follows:

* 70% directly invested into the technological roadmap
* 20% for new licences in Europe
* 10% towards marketing and growth efforts

## Business Activities:

* __*What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?*__

Their aim was to simplify crypto investment by integrating exchange functions, providing ability to buy/sell crypto and advanced crypto portfolio management. They also integrated community-ownership and input as part of the platform coin ownership as well as voting rights, so people maintain interested and help shape the direction of the company while sharing future success. Above all, bring the ability to gain wealth to everyone rather than just the top 0.1%.

* __*Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?*__
  __*What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)*__

They target everyone, crypto investors and believers in SwissBorg. They have over 706k verified users and growing. While they offer ability to buy and sell crypto, they are much more than a crypto exchange. They released a Smartphone App for users that provides passive earning and yield opportinuties. CHSB Yield provides a conservative single investment interest methods for assets. CHSB Earn provides multiple strategy options to distributed assets. SwissBorg also offers payouts linked to the performance of their own ecosystem, rewarding people for long term investment in CHSB, a bit like CHSB term deposits in the comnpany. They have various tiers for this depending on your investment. 

Some of their more recent capability releases includes SwissBorg Thematics. This is a clever feature allowing people to purchase crypto in similar market verticle bundles, a bit like stockmarket EFTs, but for crypto. These features, as well as asset and portfolio analysis, are all backed by their own advanced AI algorithms. 

In addition to the above intellectual property (IP) they commit constant efforts into ongoing regulation. While that is constantly changing direction, they need to remain compliant. This is actually another competitive advantage in itself as obtaining and maintaining compliance is no smaller undertaking.

* __*Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?*__
  __*(This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)*__

The CHSB token is a utility token on the Ethereum blockchain which is used to access their services on the SwissBorg platform. They are Web3 and decentralised finance (DeFi) focused. Web3 itself is claimed to be marketing spin, but essentially it means using a distributed development model. 

_A slight tangent, but another company - Protocol Labs - wrote InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) which is the basis for distributed Internet on blockchain. It is also the basis for Filecoin (another one I have invested in) which is distributed remote storage._

## Landscape:

* __*What domain of the financial industry is the company in?*__

Crypto Wealth Management based on Blockchain technology. 

* __*What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?*__

Many companies are still discussing blockchain technology in the wealth management market, there are articles written as recently as last year talking about it like it is not happening yet. Meanwhile, SwissBorg has been continuing to expand their offering since 2017.

* __*What are the other major companies in this domain?*__

There aren't many! There are plenty of crypto portfolio management companies, but they don't provide the service on blockchain technology.

One company that is blockchain based that is similar is Insight Protocol (INX). However, their market cap is only $80k USD so they are small in relation to SwissBorg in that regard. The all time high of the INX token was 0.32 USD compared to CHSB reaching $1.64 USD.  They also do not offer so many features. They are a regulated blockchain based crypto trading platform. They were the SEC registered security token to IPO and do offer other IPO style investments, a capital raising function, but that is about it. They don't offer the same interest earning features that SwissBorg do with Earn/Yield.

## Results

* __*What has been the business impact of this company so far?*__

They are on the leading edge for Blockchain Wealth Management and other than the market affecting their market cap they have been on an upward trajectory. The biggest hurdle for the company so far has been compliance. This is the reason their growth, from an availability stand point, has been slower than it would be otherwise. The SwissBorg app is not yet available in the USA or Australia for example.

To become a "verified user" they follow strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti Money Laundering (AML) requirements (which I went through myself when investing initially!). This ensures the app is not used illegally. They also have transaction monitoring and anti-fraud intelligence to abide with applicable regulations.

Having said that, they are managing growth sensibly and protecting their position in the process. They hold 2/3rds of their proprietary assets in fiat/stablecoins, which offsets the volatility in other crypto assets. The remaining 1/3 is crypto where mostly invested in top 10 coins with strong positions, such as BTC and ETH.

* __*What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?*__

SwissBorg hit unicorn status in 2022 with a $1B market cap, reaching roughly $1.4B in March 2021. Looking at todays figures, they have pegged back to $200m, but this scenario is across the board with the state of the international financial markets today, post pandemic.

* __*How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?*__

If you Google Blockchain Wealth Management, you will find articles from 2017, 2018, 2019, maybe 2020 plus a handful from 2022. It appears that this is not a market that the intrinsict Wealth Management market is taking seriously. There are endless companies offering "crypto" portfolio management today, but they, themselves are far from invested in the technology, merely another souless vessel to another financial product. 

## Recommendations

* __*If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)*__

Focus on expanding international licensing to enable faster uptake of their Smartphone App and the platform in general.

* __*Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?*__

Their main hinderance is lack of international expansion, or the hinderance due to intense regulation.

* __*What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?*__

Their roadmap is exciting. The current restriction is licensing and regulation. Their growth is hindered by regulation and not by technology,

* __*Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?*__

They already work. It is red tape that hinders.
